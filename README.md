# Test Project Documentation

The test project was created using the eShop project as a reference.  
This project was chosen because it follows recommended practices and serves as a baseline for project creation.

The documentation for the eShop project can be found at: [eShop Documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/tree/release/8.0).

## Benefits of the eShopOnContainers Project for Testing

The **eShopOnContainers**, available in the [eShop repository](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop/tree/release/8.0), is a Microsoft reference solution that provides a practical implementation of a microservices-based architecture. This project serves as an excellent foundation for building tests in modern and distributed environments, offering several technical advantages, as outlined below:

### 1. Realistic Basis for Test Scenarios
- The eShopOnContainers simulates a real-world e-commerce environment, providing complete microservices that include features such as shopping cart, payment, and authentication.
- Enables testing of complex business flows in a realistic context.

### 2. Comprehensive Support for Automated Testing
- Integration with **xUnit** and other testing frameworks simplifies the creation of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Pre-configured tests in the repository facilitate replication and extension to specific scenarios.

### 3. Modern and Modular Architecture
- The solution is designed following best practices like **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **CQRS**.
- Allows testing and validation of implementations based on modern patterns.

### 4. Containers with Docker and Kubernetes
- Native configurations for Docker and Kubernetes enable testing in isolated and reproducible environments.
- Ideal for validating behavior in distributed systems, including scalability and resilience.

### 5. Wide Technology Coverage
- Integration with technologies such as:
  - **.NET 8.0**: State-of-the-art development platform.
  - **gRPC** and **HTTP APIs**: Test inter-service communication.
  - **Databases (SQL Server and MongoDB)**: Test data persistence and manipulation.
- Supports event-driven architectures with **RabbitMQ** and **EventBus**, allowing validation of asynchronous messaging scenarios.

### 6. Simplified Configuration
- Pre-configured scripts for local and cloud deployment.
- Detailed setup documentation reduces the time needed to prepare the test environment.

### 7. Learning and Comparison Tool
- Ideal for teams wanting to learn and experiment with best practices in a well-established environment.
- Enables comparison of results between different approaches and tools.

With **eShopOnContainers**, developers and testers gain access to a cutting-edge environment that accelerates the development of robust solutions while improving the quality and reliability of tests.
